The formation of resilient communities through the economy of transit using NFTs as a metropass is an entirely new concept. I argue that by digitizing communities at the regional level, it is possible to cut through global noise and remove bots, and foreign influences on municipal and state/provincial affairs. The use of NFTs as a metropass enables users to become their own social media-like platforms and personalize their experiences across virtualized communities. I suggests that using Binance Smart Chain NFT based metropasses and .bnb domains could generate cash positive revenue for a localized community, creating jobs, subsidizing transit, and funding projects such as capital repairs or expansion.

The concept of community resilience has become increasingly important in today’s rapidly changing world. In order to build resilient communities, it is essential to focus on the economy of transit and the role that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can play as a metropass. Lets explore how digitizing communities at the regional level can help to remove bots and foreign influences on municipal and state/provincial affairs, and how NFTs can be used to personalize the user experience across virtualized platforms.

One of the key benefits of digitizing communities is that it allows for the creation of a “digital commons” where individuals can interact and transact with one another in a decentralized, and autonomous manner. This is particularly important in the context of transit, as it allows for the creation of a local economy that is not dependent on centralized institutions or foreign influences.

NFTs, as a metropass, can play a critical role in building resilient communities by enabling individuals to become their own platforms. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be used to represent ownership of a physical or digital item. In the context of transit, NFTs can be used to represent ownership of a metropass, which can be used to access a variety of transportation services within a community. Or access benefits at a participating retailer whom offers rewards, or discounted incentives.

One particularly promising application of NFTs as a metropass is the use of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) based NFTs and .bnb domains. BSC is a fast and efficient blockchain that can handle high transaction volumes, making it well-suited for use in a metropass system. Additionally, .bnb domains can be used to personalize the user experience across virtualized platforms, allowing individuals to easily access and manage “community based credentials” within “threaded mail”. Identity is at the centre of potential governance opportunities, and we can choose to be our pseudonymical selves.

The use of NFTs as a metropass and .bnb domains can also generate significant revenue for communities. The ad revenue generated by a community using NFTs as a metropass can be used to create jobs, subsidize transit, and fund projects such as capital repairs or expansion. Additionally, the use of .bnb domains can open up new opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs within the community.

By using NFTs as a metropass, individuals are able to have more control and autonomy over their transit experience. NFT metropasses can be personalized and tailored to the individual’s needs, allowing them to access the specific transportation services that they require. Additionally, the use of NFTs can also increase transparency and accountability within the transit system, as all transactions can be tracked and recorded on the blockchain.

Furthermore, the use of NFTs as a metropass can also create new opportunities for innovation and experimentation within the transit system. For example, it can enable the creation of new business models, such as pay-per-use or subscription-based models, that were not previously possible. This can lead to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness within the transit system, benefiting both the community and the individuals that use it.

In addition, NFTs as a metropass can also help to build more inclusive and equitable communities. By enabling individuals to have greater control over their transit experience, it can help to break down barriers to access, particularly for marginalized and low-income communities. This can have a positive impact on social and economic mobility within the community.

The use of NFTs as a metropass has the potential to play a critical role in building resilient communities by enabling individuals to become their own platforms, increasing transparency and accountability, enabling innovation and experimentation, and fostering inclusivity and equity.

An NFT as a metropass can turn the user into their own social media platform… or platform the user by providing them with a unique digital identity and service interface. That way they can use both to access various services and interact with other individuals within the community.

By using an NFT as a metropass, individuals can access transportation services, but they could also use it as a form of identification, which would enable them to access other services such as social media, e-commerce, and online marketplaces. This digital identity can be personalized and tailored to the individual’s needs, allowing them to access and interact with the specific services, and individuals that they require.

Additionally, the use of an NFT metropass can also enable individuals to monetize their digital identity and the data associated with it. For example, an individual could sell advertising space on their digital identity, or share data about their transportation usage with third parties. This can create new opportunities for individuals to generate revenue and increase their economic mobility.

Furthermore, an NFT metropass could also enable individuals to have more control over their data and privacy. By using a decentralized and autonomous system, individuals can have more control over the data that is collected about them and who has access to it. This can help to mitigate the risks associated with centralized social media platforms, such as data breaches and privacy violations.

Thus far,\
we have discussed the importance of community resilience and the role that NFTs can play in building resilient communities through the economy of transit. By digitizing communities at the regional level, it is possible to remove bots and foreign influences on municipal and state/provincial affairs. NFTs can be used as a metropass to enable individuals to become their own platforms and personalize their experiences across virtualized communities. Additionally, the use of Binance Smart Chain NFTs and .bnb domains can generate significant ad revenue for localized communities, creating jobs, subsidizing transit, and funding projects such as capital repairs or expansion. An NFT as a metropass can turn the user into their own social media platform by providing them with a unique digital identity & surface interface that they can use to access various services, and interact with other individuals within the community. It can also enable individuals to monetize their digital identity and have more control over their data and privacy.

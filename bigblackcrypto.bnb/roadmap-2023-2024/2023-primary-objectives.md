# üçÅ2023: Primary Objectives

## Q4.2 + Q4.3:

**Building Community -**\
We will actively buidl out community's as a means to maintain organizational contact between "community(s)" and their respective programs. This is essential in a rapidly virtualized world where the pandemic has distanced us from one another.&#x20;

## Q1

**COMMUNITY BUIDLING** -\
We will continue supporting the multi-chain efforts of other naming services whilest buidling out new communities. We believe the market to be so vast, so large, that the CAGR alone in IVM's make's it unnecessary to view others as competition. We will focus on serving users, and assisting developers as a "technical" liason". Utilizing our fundamental analysis we will continue to seek out new integrations, partnerships, and collabs. Creating utility beyond current use case. &#x20;

**SAGA MOBILE - Beta testing + zApp Development**\
****We've reserved a cellphone, and applied under the developer program. It's a chance to get familiar with mobile app development. \

In owning over 300+ domains we will still issue "traditional" domains. 10% of our portfolio will test open market. Revenue generated from said TLD's will be reinvested into enhancing dApp development, & the hosting of a name server(s). We also own over 100 .bnb handles as well.  We own our namesake on over 20 chains.

# ðŸ˜¤ 2024: MISSION

### **Q1 - CBaaS: Community Building as a Service (Cont'd)**

* [ ] Further mass adoption&#x20;
  * [ ] Introduce wallet to new user base(s)
  * [ ] Virtualize new "watering holes" (secure more deals domestically)
  * [ ] Strengthen localized economies
  * [ ] Empower user lvl agency & self custody

### Q2 -

### NFTaaS - Exploring: NFT's as a Service

Now that NFT's can be app's it's worth considering how they can be applied as more than just a means of token gating access. We'll apply this method to an issue that leads to $1.5T of loss... \
"How can NFTaaS re-capture economic outflows like the 1.5T subverted from public coffers, as I identified in underground economies"...

* [ ] Pitch service to 550,000 membered group

### Q3 -

Begin sale of Lifetime governance NFT's&#x20;

* 100,000 passes (w/ 50 tiers pricing)

### Q4 -

**2024: DAO Governance** -\
The formation of a DAO is indeed a sincere possibility.... it still requires group to decide the "when" parameter. &#x20;

_**Introduce new "decentralized" meta platforms...**_ \
eg: a new lowcode twitter or facebook, where users retain their own data records... and can import their own data to gain "reputational" legacy....&#x20;

It'd be the equivalent of cloning an account, but only via deep authentication..&#x20;

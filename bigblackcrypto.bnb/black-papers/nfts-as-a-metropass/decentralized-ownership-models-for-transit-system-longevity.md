The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. They are a member of the National Football League (NFL) and compete in the league‚Äôs National Football Conference (NFC) North division.

One unique aspect of the Green Bay Packers is their ownership structure, which is organized as a non-profit, community-owned corporation. This means that the team is owned by a group of shareholders, rather than by a single owner or a corporation. The shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the team‚Äôs operations and make important decisions.

The Packers‚Äô community-owned model is intended to ensure that the team remains connected to the Green Bay community and that its operations are transparent and accountable to the public. It is also designed to prevent the team from being moved to another city, as the Packers have deep roots in Green Bay and a strong fan base in the region.

The Packers‚Äô community-owned model has been successful in many ways. The team has won 13 NFL championships, including four Super Bowls, and has a dedicated fan base that supports the team through thick and thin. The team‚Äôs financial stability has also allowed it to invest in its facilities and infrastructure, including the construction of Lambeau Field, one of the most iconic and well-known stadiums in the NFL.

The Green Bay Packers‚Äô decentralized ownership model is a unique and innovative approach to professional sports team ownership that has helped to ensure the team‚Äôs long-term success and stability.

_**The DAO-ification of Transit Systems ‚Äî**_

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a type of organization that is run using decentralized blockchain technology and is governed by rules encoded in smart contracts. Like the Green Bay Packers, a DAO is owned and controlled by a group of stakeholders, rather than by a single owner or corporation.

One key difference between a DAO and the Green Bay Packers is that a DAO is fully decentralized and operates on a blockchain, meaning that it is not bound by geography or traditional legal structures. This allows a DAO to operate independently and transparently, with decision-making processes that are open and transparent to all stakeholders.

A DAO is governed by a set of rules and protocols that are encoded in smart contracts and stored on the blockchain. These rules define how the DAO operates and how decisions are made, and they can be updated, or modified by the DAO‚Äôs stakeholders through a voting process.

Like the Green Bay Packers, a DAO is owned and controlled by a group of stakeholders, who have a say in the direction, and operations of the organization. However, in a DAO, these stakeholders are often dispersed around the globe and may not have a personal connection to the organization in the same way that the shareholders of the Green Bay Packers do.

A DAO is similar to the Green Bay Packers in that it is owned and controlled by a group of stakeholders and operates according to a set of rules and protocols. However, a DAO is fully decentralized and operates on a blockchain, which gives it some unique characteristics and capabilities compared to traditional organizations like the Green Bay Packers.

_**Extending Governance Rights to NFTaaM Holders ‚Äî**_

When discussing the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent metropasses, it is important to consider the governance rights that may be associated with these NFTs. Governance rights refer to the power or authority that holders of an NFT may have to influence the decision-making processes of an organization or project.

In the context of metropasses, governance rights could potentially be tied to the NFTs in a number of ways. For example, holders of NFT metropasses may be granted the right to vote on certain decisions related to the public transportation system; such as fare increases or route changes. Alternatively, the NFTs could be designed to grant holders access to certain perks or privileges, such as priority boarding or discounts on other services.

Another way in which governance rights could be exercised in the context of NFT metropasses is through subscriber polling. Subscriber polling refers to the process of collecting feedback and opinions from subscribers or customers through surveys or polls. In the context of NFT metropasses, this could involve sending out surveys or polls to holders of the NFTs, asking for their input on various issues related to the public transportation system. This could be done through in-mail (threaded posts within an e-mail) or other forms of electronic communication.

The inclusion of governance rights in NFT metropasses could provide a way for the holders of these tokens to have a say in the decisions that affect the public transportation system, and could also help to create a more responsive and customer-focused system.

_**Governance as a Means to Social Cohesion ‚Äî**_

Inclusion refers to the act of actively involving and engaging diverse groups of people in the decision-making processes and activities of an organization or community. Inclusion can take many forms, such as involving people of different ages, genders, races, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds in the decision-making process.

Inclusion is important for social cohesion because it helps to create a sense of belonging and connection among people who may have different backgrounds and perspectives. When people feel included and valued, they are more likely to feel a sense of loyalty and commitment to the group or community. This, in turn, can lead to a stronger sense of social cohesion, or the feeling of togetherness and unity within a group or community.

One way in which inclusion can be achieved is through the use of polling and other forms of feedback and consultation. Polling is a process of collecting the opinions and views of a group of people on a particular issue or question. It can be an effective way to ensure that all voices are heard and that diverse perspectives are taken into account when making decisions.

The literal definition of plasticity, is the ‚Äúability of certain solids to flow or to change shape permanently when subjected to stresses of intermediate magnitude between those producing temporary deformation, or elastic behaviour, and those causing failure of the material, or rupture.‚Äù

In the context of hive plasticity, polling can be a key factor in the ability of a group to reach consensus and make decisions that effectively protect the health of a larger populous. A system is easily shaped, aiming for an improved mode of transport. This transfer of information en mass through a channel of choice, can be thought of as a neural highway. With gossip as a form of communication that involves the exchange of information or rumors within a group. When used in conjunction with polling, gossip can help to spread information and ideas within a group, facilitating the exchange of ideas, rumours and opinions which help to reach consensus.

This is how _inclusion_, and the use of polling and gossip can play a key role in promoting _**social cohesion**_. Enabling a group to make decisions effectively. By involving diverse voices and perspectives in the decision-making process, a group can reach a more informed and nuanced understanding of an issue, leading to better outcomes for all members of the community.

Fractionalized Ownership ‚Äî

Fractionalized ownership refers to the practice of dividing ownership of an asset or property into smaller units or shares, which can then be owned by multiple people or entities. Fractionalized ownership can be applied to a wide range of assets, including real estate, art, collectibles, and other valuable items‚Ä¶. in this case ever, transportation systems.

One potential benefit of fractionalized ownership is that it can make a city more resilient. This is because fractionalized ownership can allow more people or organizations to have a stake in the assets and resources of a city, which can help to spread risk and ensure that the city has a diverse and robust economic base.

For example, if a city has a single owner or a small group of owners controlling all of its major assets, it may be more vulnerable to economic downturns or other challenges. If these owners face financial difficulties or lose interest in the assets, it could have a negative impact on the city‚Äôs economy.

On the other hand, if ownership of a city‚Äôs assets is fractionalized and spread out among a larger group of people or organizations, it can make the city more resilient to changes in the economic environment. This is because a diverse group of owners with different backgrounds, and interests can provide a greater degree of stability, and security for the city‚Äôs assets and resources.

It should be noted that, fractionalized ownership can be a useful tool for promoting resilience and stability in a city. This is achieved by allowing more people and organizations to have a stake in the city‚Äôs assets and resources.

_**Utilizing a Subscriber Based Model ‚Äî Opting In/Opting Out**_

City councillors can use various tools and technologies to collect real-time feedback from large numbers of people. One way to do this is through the use of a subscriber model, in which people can sign up to receive updates and communication from the city council.

One advantage of a subscriber model is that it allows city councillors to reach a large audience quickly and efficiently. By collecting email addresses or phone numbers from subscribers, councillors can send out updates, surveys, and other forms of communication to a large group of people in a matter of minutes. This can be particularly useful for gathering feedback on important issues or decisions that are being considered by the council. _**Through web3 we can make this information exchange incredibly gated, & permissioned to the ownership of a wallet for thwarting foreign influence.**_

Another advantage of a subscriber model is that it allows city councillors to receive feedback from a diverse group of people, including residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. This can help to ensure that a wide range of perspectives and views are taken into account when making decisions.

There are several ways that city councillors can use a subscriber model to gather real-time feedback from people. For example, they could send out surveys or polls to subscribers, asking for their opinions on specific issues or proposals. This could also allow users to put forth proposals of their own. They could also set up online forums or chat rooms where subscribers can discuss issues and provide feedback in a threaded style of format.

Overall, a subscriber model can be a useful tool for city councillors to collect real-time feedback from large numbers of people. By allowing people to sign up to receive updates and communication from the council, councillors can reach a large and diverse audience and gather valuable insights and perspectives on important issues facing the city. However, are city councillors who have sworn to serve a city‚Ä¶ will they be capable of such transparency & inclusion?

_**Fractionalized Governance ‚Äî**_

Fractionalized governance refers to the practice of dividing governance responsibilities or decision-making authority among a larger group of people or organizations. _**This can be seen as a form of decentralization**_, in which power and authority are distributed more widely rather than concentrated in a single entity.

There are several potential benefits of fractionalized governance, especially when applied to state or local governments. **One benefit is that it can help to promote democracy and participation by giving more people a say in the decisions that affect their lives.** By allowing a wider range of voices and perspectives to be heard, fractionalized governance can help to create a more inclusive and representative decision-making process.

Another benefit of fractionalized governance is that it can promote transparency and accountability. When power and authority are distributed more widely, it can be easier for people to see how decisions are being made and to hold decision-makers accountable for their actions. This can help to create a more responsive and accountable government, which is essential for building trust and confidence in the political system.

Fractionalized governance can also help to promote resilience and stability. When power is distributed more widely, it can be more difficult for any single group or individual to dominate or control the decision-making process. This can help to prevent the concentration of power and reduce the risk of corruption or abuse of power.

Ultimately, fractionalized governance can be a useful tool for promoting democracy, transparency, accountability, and resilience in state and local governments. By allowing a wider range of voices and perspectives to be heard. This is achieved by distributing power and authority more widely, fractionalized governance can help to create a more inclusive and representative decision-making process that serves the needs of the people.

Anti-Privatization Factor ‚Äî

Fractionalized governance can potentially help to prevent private companies from looting city coffers by increasing transparency and accountability in the contracting process.

When a city government enters into a contract with a private company, it is important that the terms of the contract are fair and reasonable, and that the city is getting a good value for its money. Fractionalized governance can help to ensure this by allowing more people or organizations to have a say in the contracting process and by making it more transparent and open to scrutiny.

For example, if a city government has a decentralized decision-making process, with power and authority distributed among a larger group of people or organizations, it can be more difficult for a single company or individual to dominate the contracting process. This can help to prevent corruption or favoritism, ensuring that contracts are awarded based on merit rather than on personal or political connections.

In addition, fractionalized governance can help to increase transparency and accountability by making it easier for people to see how contracts are being awarded and to hold decision-makers accountable for their actions. This can be especially important when it comes to large or complex contracts, where the terms and conditions may not be easily understood by the general public.

Overall, fractionalized governance can be a useful tool for preventing private companies from looting city coffers by increasing transparency and accountability in the contracting process. By allowing more people or organizations to have a say in the contracting process and by making it more open and transparent, fractionalized governance can help to ensure that contracts are fair and reasonable and that the city is getting a good value for its money.

In summary, we discussed how decentralized and fractionalized ownership structures can be used to govern organizations, assets, and resources. Decentralized ownership structures, such as how the Green Bay Packers and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), involve the ownership and control of an organization by a group of stakeholders rather than a single owner or corporation. Fractionalized ownership refers to the practice of dividing ownership of an asset or property into smaller units or shares that can be owned by multiple people or entities. Both of these structures can promote resilience, transparency, and accountability, and can be applied to a wide range of assets.

We also explored the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a way to represent and govern resources, such as metropasses, and discussed the role of governance rights and subscriber polling in facilitating the exchange of ideas and opinions within a group. Finally, we looked at fractionalized governance, which involves dividing governance responsibilities or decision-making authority among a larger group of people or organizations, and discussed the potential benefits of this approach, such as promoting democracy and transparency.

_**NFTaaM ‚Äî NFT-as-a-Metropass:**_\
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can potentially be used to represent metropasses and offer a number of potential benefits. Some potential benefits of using NFTs as metropasses include:

* Governance rights: NFTs can potentially be designed to grant holders certain governance rights, such as the right to vote on decisions or access to perks or privileges. This can help to create a more inclusive and representative decision-making process and give people a say in the decisions that affect their lives.
* Transparency and accountability: By using NFTs to represent metropasses, it can be easier to track the use and distribution of the passes, which can help to increase transparency and accountability in the public transportation system.
* Improved security: NFTs can offer improved security compared to traditional metropasses, as they can be easily verified and authenticated using blockchain technology. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud or counterfeiting and ensure that the metropasses are used only by authorized users.

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*WxLxI4fmtZDNLpjrZG8m6Q.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The world is facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions. Climate change and the decarbonization of our economy are the defining issues of our time, and we must act now to address them. One way to do this is through the gamification of decarbonization, using innovative technologies like NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and blockchain to incentivize and reward individuals and organizations for their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a more sustainable future.

Lets explore the potential of NFTs as a service, or NaaS/ NFTaaS, to drive the gameification of decarbonization. We examine the role that digital currencies, and blockchain can play in 10x-ing the Canadian GDP and the growth of the identity verification market. We delve into the concept of gameification, explaining how it can be used to fundraise billions of dollars for capital repairs, and pay for the transition to a cleaner, greener future.

We also examine the burgeoning NFTaaS industry and the various types of services that it offers, including authentifiers, auctions, and decentralized ownership models. We discuss the potential of payment streaming and rebate programs to encourage local travel through the use of immersive technologies like AR/VR/IR/XR for tourism to do so.

Naturally we then explore the role of A.I. in driving the gameification of decarbonization, including the concept of A.I. sentience and the use of hive plasticity and federations to bring about social cohesion and community integration. We also delve into the concept of Wokenomics, a term we use to describe the intersection of the digital economy and social activism, and the ways in which it can be harnessed to drive positive change.

Climate change and the decarbonization of our economy are pressing issues that require immediate action. The gameification of decarbonization refers to the use of incentives and rewards to motivate individuals and organizations to reduce carbon emissions, with transitioning to a more sustainable future in mind. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and blockchain technology can be used to support this process by providing a platform for tracking, & rewarding progress towards decarbonization goals.

The concept of Wokenomics takes on an extrapolatory role, which refers to the intersection of the digital economy and social activism, and how it can be leveraged to drive positive change. Through the gameification of decarbonization, we have the opportunity to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all. It is up to us to take advantage of this opportunity and make it a reality.

NFTs-as-a-Service, or NaaS, refers to the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a service offering. NFTs are digital assets, that can transcend a given value far too often limited by their fiat associated value. They are often used to represent ownership of digital items such as art, music, and collectibles.

NFTs-as-a-Service can be thought of as the service its-self or as simply the access to goods or experiences. A year ago NFT‚Äôs were just under pixelated 4 bit jpegs without a soul‚Ä¶. now their fully fledged apps w/ AI sentience‚Ä¶ these aren‚Äôt your NFT‚Äôs from 6 months ago either. However, 6 months from now they could be used to form the ‚Äúneural highways‚Äù of an emergent ‚Äúhive plasticity‚Äù. Crypto is a fast paced iterative space. For example, A music festival might use NFTs to sell tickets and offer exclusive experiences to VIP ticket holders‚Ä¶ and then mutate to a discoverable rarity post-performance added fanfare.

NFTs can also be used to represent the fractionalized ownership of physical items, such as real estate or artwork. Or as the simple fragment of a much larger consortium of individuals collective realty. They can be used to track things via gps‚Ä¶. there are some fitness based NFTs that might surprise you. But for a more living, breathing, ever evolving NFT we can code into it a Zk-Rollup to only share say distance & not location.

NFTs-as-a-Service represents a new way of offering and accessing goods and services, leveraging the unique capabilities of NFTs to provide value and facilitate transactions. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be used to ‚Äúgate‚Äù membership in real life. I desire strongly to identify use cases that enhance the human experience.

\-

One way that NFTs are used as a service is through the creation of authentifiers, which are digital tokens that verify the authenticity of a user. (Authentifier in French means ‚Äúauthenticate‚Äù). These can be simple access tokens, or soul-bound tokens (SBT-class) that bind asset to user like ‚ÄúBAB‚Äù. Anticipate all exchanges to do this in the future at some point.

Note that an artist might create an NFT authentifier to prove the authenticity of a limited edition print of their artwork. Example 1 of 50 editions minted on-chain. My SAGA NFT, and my NODE reservations are bound to me. Another way that NFTs can be used as a service is through the issuances of rewards during in-game activities. Value distribution can be envisioned in a much more dynamic, action/reactive way than previously coded.

NFTs are also being used to facilitate fundraising efforts, and capital repairs through auctions via decentralized ownership models. NFTs can be used to streamline payment processes and enable the use of immersive technologies like AR/VR/IR/XR for tourism and other industries alike. I‚Äôm quite shocked more cities aren‚Äôt taking a ‚Äúpokenmon go‚Äù approach to their cities. AI sentience could make for a very responsive tour guide. As the use of NFTs continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses for NFTaaS in the future.

\-

There are many different types of NFTs-as-a-Service, or NFTaaS, depending on the specific use case and the needs of the individuals or organizations involved. Review of NFTaaS types:

1. Authentifiers: Digital tokens that verify the authenticity of physical items, such as artwork or collectibles.
2. Real estate: The sale or lease of digital properties, such as virtual land or in-game items. They can also be fractionalized to represent decentralized ownership of real-world-assets (irl-rwa‚Äôs).
3. Auctions: The use of NFTs to facilitate fundraising efforts, or capital repairs through the sale of digital assets.
4. Decentralized ownership models: The use of NFTs to enable shared ownership or decentralized decision-making within organizations, such as sports teams and businesses.
5. Payment streaming: The use of NFTs to streamline payment processes, like channeled routing
6. Promotional integration for tourism using innovative technologies like AR/VR/IR/XR for tourism and other industries.
7. Fundraising: Platforms that use NFTs to facilitate fundraising efforts, such as capital repairs or other projects.
8. Identity verification: NFTs that are used to verify the identity of individuals or organizations, enabling secure and reliable online transactions.
9. Rewards programs: NFTs that are used to reward individuals or organizations for their efforts to reduce carbon emissions or transition to a more sustainable future.
10. Supply chain management: NFTs that are used to track and verify the origin and authenticity of goods as they move through the supply chain‚Ä¶ from first part to final destination.
11. Copyright protection: NFTs that are used to prove ownership of intellectual property, such as art, music, or literature. Recently a small crypto exchange in Europe used an NFT to issue a lawsuit‚Ä¶

These are just a few examples of the many types of NFTs-as-a-Service that are being used or developed. As the use of NFTs continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses for NaaS in the future.

Again, this is just a small sample of the many different types of NFT-as-a-Service that are being used or developed. The potential applications for NFTs are vast and continue to grow and evolve as the technology advances.

These are just seven benefits to using NFTs-as-a-Service and metropasses as NFTs:

1. Verification: NFTs can be used to verify the authenticity of physical items, such as artwork, collectibles, or other valuable assets. This can help to prevent counterfeiting and ensure that buyers are getting what they are paying for. This can also turn metropasses into virtualized collectibles, creating secondary markets.
2. Decentralization: NFTs stored on a blockchain, allow for decentralized ownership and control. This can be particularly useful for assets that are owned by a community, such as sports teams or other organizations, even a citizenry.
3. Streamlined payments: NFTs can streamline payment processes and enable the use of programmable smart monies, making it easier to transfer value between parties.
4. Immersive experiences: NFTs can facilitate the use of immersive technologies like AR/VR/IR/XR, allowing users to experience new environments and events in a more immersive way. You can turn an entire city into an avatar expanse, bringing vibrant opportunity to any neighbourhood willing to adopt its use.
5. Fundraising: NFTs can be used to facilitate fundraising efforts, such as capital repairs or other projects, by enabling the sale of unique digital assets. This could be achieved in a ‚ÄúGreenbay Packer Model‚Äù.
6. Rewards programs: NFTs can be used to reward individuals or organizations for their efforts to reduce carbon emissions or transition to a more sustainable future. Local business could adopt a ‚Äúmetropass‚Äù discount plan or menu to incentive business and decarbonization‚Ä¶ a metropass could accrue points at the business the user frequents.

\-

Metropasses as NFTs, in particular, can offer several benefits. For example, an NFT metropass can enable continuous discounts for users, campaignification and retail benefits, with enhanced service analytics. They can also strengthen localized market activity and create neural highways, promoting the use of public transit thus reducing the need for private vehicle ownership. In addition, NFT metropasses can enable platforming of transit systems giving pass holders a voice in governance, encouraging community involvement and engagement.

Metropasses as NFTs can offer any business the following:

1. Continuous discounts: NFT metropasses can enable users to receive continuous discounts on their fares or other services, providing an ongoing incentive to use public transit.
2. Augmented Reality ‚Äî AR Way Finding in large indoor spaces, 3D spatials, and optimized tour guiding.
3. Campaignification: NFT metropasses can be used to promote campaigns or other initiatives, such as efforts to reduce carbon emissions or encourage the use of public transit.
4. Retail Benefits: NFT metropasses can be used to offer retail benefits, such as discounts at participating retailers or other perks, encouraging users to engage with local businesses. Making localized markets resilient because of the connections formed.
5. Enhanced Service Analytics: NFT metropasses can enable the collection and analysis of large data sets at scale on transit usage and defined preferences. Thus allowing for the optimization of services, the development of new features. and enhanced routing.
6. Strengthened Localized Market Activity: By encouraging the use of public transit and reducing the need for private vehicle ownership, NFT metropasses can help to strengthen localized market activity and promote economic development in the surrounding areas. What‚Äôs your SLMA rating? Most folks don‚Äôt have a formula on how to access there impact or penetration in the surrounding area.
7. Neural highways: NFT metropasses can help to create neural highways in both the subject, and infrastructure development. Promoting the use of public transit whilest encouraging the development of infrastructure that supports sustainable transportation amidst intense densification of urban developments. From deep brain A.I. to end user query type symbiosis‚Ä¶ from user granularity to community en mass, or system as a whole. This can be simply achieved by ‚Äúdiscount for data‚Äù DFD-class NaaS models, where pass is ‚Äúsoul bound‚Äù till expiry date. Much like a car‚Äôs OEM, its just nft number, & data of interaction, & distance travelled‚Ä¶ or last tap. Structure the desire for an efficient commute w/ incentivized rewards and suddenly how we use NFT‚Äôs or metropasses changes dramatically.
8. Platforming of transit systems: NFT metropasses enable the platforming of transit systems. Allowing for the development of new features, and services. Encouraging community involvement and engagement. We could turn every ‚Äúlifetime pass‚Äù into a gps node & truly offer analytics at scale‚Ä¶

NFT metropasses offer a range of benefits that can encourage the use of public transit, reduce carbon emissions, and promote sustainable transportation and economic development.

The mass adoption of crypto can potentially grow from the use of NFT metropasses in a few ways. First, NFT metropasses can make it easier for individuals to engage with and use crypto, as they provide a familiar and practical use case for the technology. By using NFT metropasses to pay for transit fares or access other services, individuals can gain firsthand experience with crypto and become more comfortable using it in their daily lives.

It is important to remember, NFT‚Äôs aren‚Äôt just static jpeg‚Äôs anymore, they can also be fully programmable apps. The developments in web3 iterate new innovations rapidly.

Second, NFT metropasses can help to promote the wider adoption of crypto by increasing its visibility and accessibility. As more individuals begin using NFT metropasses, they may be more likely to share their experiences with others and encourage them to try using crypto as well. In addition, NFT metropasses can make it easier for individuals to acquire and use crypto, as they can be purchased and redeemed directly through the transit system.

NFT metropasses can help to drive the mass adoption of crypto by demonstrating its potential and utility. By offering a range of benefits, such as continuous discounts, retail perks, and enhanced service analytics, NFT metropasses can show how crypto can be used to improve everyday experiences and create value for users. As more individuals see the benefits of using crypto, they may be more likely to adopt it themselves.

According to the International Association of Public Transport (UITP), there are approximately 53 billion public transit trips taken globally each year. However, this number likely includes all forms of public transit, including buses, trains, subways, and other modes of transportation.

The gamification of metropasses can refer to the use of game-like elements or incentives to encourage the use of public transit and promote sustainability. This can include things like rewards programs, campaigns, or other initiatives that aim to make using public transit more enjoyable and engaging for users.

One reason why gamification of metropasses may be necessary is to counter privatization in public spaces. Privatization refers to the transfer of ownership or control of a public asset or service to a private entity. In the context of public transit, privatization can occur when public transit systems are sold or leased to private companies, or when private companies are contracted to provide transit services.

The gamification of metropasses can help to counter privatization in public spaces by promoting the use of public transit, and supporting the development of sustainable transportation infrastructure. By offering a range of incentives and benefits to users, gamification can encourage more people to use public transit, which can help to sustain and grow these systems over time. This, in turn, can help to counter the privatization of public spaces, as it can make it less attractive for private companies to take over or control these assets.

Additionally, the platforming of transit systems through the use of NFT metropasses can enable pass holders to have a voice in governance and decision-making, further promoting the sustainability and public control of these systems. By giving users a say in the direction and management of the transit system, platforming can help to counter privatization and ensure that the interests of the public are always taken into account regardless of the government in power. Its a counter measure to the abuse of absolute power when dealing with majority governments at a state/provincial level.

It is important to have a governance metric for metropass NFTs for a few reasons:

1. Accountability: Governance metrics can help to ensure accountability in the use and management of metropass NFTs. By establishing clear guidelines and standards for their use, governance metrics can help to ensure that metropass NFTs are being used in a responsible and transparent manner.
2. Fairness: Governance metrics can help to ensure that the distribution and use of metropass NFTs is fair and equitable. By establishing clear rules and criteria for their distribution, governance metrics can help to prevent any potential abuses or inequities in the distribution of services, and benefits.
3. Decision-making: Governance metrics can provide a framework for decision-making around the use and management of metropass NFTs. By establishing clear criteria and processes for making decisions, governance metrics can help to ensure that the needs and interests of all stakeholders are taken into account.
4. Transparency: Governance metrics can help to promote transparency in the use and management of metropass NFTs. By establishing clear guidelines and standards for their use, governance metrics can help to ensure that the use of these NFTs is transparent and open to scrutiny.

A governance metric associated with NFTs-as-a-Service (NaaS) can help to form social cohesion in a few ways. First, a governance metric can establish clear rules and guidelines for the use of NFTaaS, which can help to build trust and confidence among users. By establishing a clear and fair framework for the use of NaaS, a governance metric can help to build a sense of shared purpose and cooperation among users.

Secondly, a governance metric can help to promote transparency and accountability in the use of NFTaaS. By establishing clear reporting and disclosure requirements, a governance metric can help to ensure that the use of NFTaaS is open and transparent, which can foster a sense of trust and cooperation among users.

A governance metric can provide a framework for decision-making around the use of NaaS, which can encourage collaboration and cooperation among users. By establishing clear processes for making decisions and involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process, a governance metric can help to build a sense of shared ownership and responsibility among users.

Hive plasticity refers to the ability of a hive or group of individuals to adapt and change in response to their environment. In the context of mass neural thinking, hive plasticity can refer to the ability of a group of individuals to think, and act as a collective, adapting and changing their behaviors and actions in response to their environment.

In terms of mass neural thinking, humans can benefit from swarm A.I. because it can help to improve decision-making and problem-solving by enabling the collective intelligence of a group. Swarm A.I. algorithms can analyze and process large amounts of data, allowing them to identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent to an individual. By incorporating the insights and knowledge of a group, swarm A.I. can help to improve decision-making when choosing best routes and problem-solving, enabling humans to make better-informed decisions, solving complex problems more effectively.

Social cohesion begins with social inclusion, as it is important for all members of a community or group to feel included, and valued in order to foster a sense of shared purpose and cooperation. Social inclusion involves ensuring that all members of a community have the opportunity to participate fully in the life of the community and to contribute to its development and well-being.

One way that metropass NFTs can utilize NFTs-as-a-service to enable on-chain voting is by using smart contracts to facilitate voting processes. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. By using smart contracts, metropass NFTs can enable users to cast their votes in a transparent and secure manner, without the need for intermediaries or third parties.

On-chain voting can be used to involve pass holders in the decision-making process around the use and management of a transit system. Promoting social inclusion, holders can input their feedback via upvotes, or in-mail commentary to have a say in the direction and operation of the transit system. By involving pass holders in the decision-making process, on-chain voting can help to foster a sense of shared ownership and responsibility among users, which can contribute to social cohesion.

On-chain governance can potentially help to reduce construction delays in a few ways. First, on-chain governance can provide a transparent and secure platform for tracking and managing construction projects, enabling all stakeholders (the public) to access real-time information about the progress and status of the project. This can help to identify and resolve any issues or bottlenecks that may be causing delays, enabling projects to move forward smoothly.

On-chain governance can facilitate better communication and coordination among all stakeholders, enabling them to work together more effectively to resolve issues or challenges that may arise. By using on-chain governance to share information and collaborate in real-time, stakeholders can more easily identify and address any problems that may be causing delays.

In-mail ‚Äúopinionating‚Äù refers to holding a dialogue among a group of subscribers within the same email, with opinionating being the commentary associated with the discussion. It may also involve the upvoting of topics within the email conversation. This can be a way for subscribers to share their opinions and ideas with others within the same email thread, allowing for more collaborative and interactive communication. In-mail opinionating can be a useful tool for facilitating discussions and decision-making among a group of individuals who are connected through email.

In-mail opinionating could potentially be a useful tool for Genesis metropass holders to share their opinions and ideas with others within the same email thread, allowing for more collaborative and interactive communication. It could also be a way for Genesis metropass holders to participate in discussions and decision-making related to the use and management of their metropass NFTs, enabling them to have a greater say in the direction and operation of the transit system as a whole.

In-mail opinionating could potentially be a useful tool for facilitating discussions and decision-making among a group of individuals who are connected through email, regardless of whether they are part of a merged community or not.

Composability refers to the ability of different systems or components to work together and be combined in different ways to form a larger whole. In the context of NFTs, composability can refer to the ability of different NFTs to be combined or used together in different ways, enabling new and innovative applications and use cases.

NFT-as-AI and NFT apps can exhibit a parasympathetic mutualism, meaning that they can work together in a way that is mutually beneficial. For example, NFT-as-AI could be used to process and analyze data from NFT apps, providing insights and information that can be used to improve the user experience and functionality of the apps. At the same time, NFT apps can provide valuable data and information that can be used to train and improve the system performance of NFT-as-AI.

In the context of metropass NFTs, using AI to enable distance tracking can potentially be used to reward travel and incentivize the use of public transit. By tracking the distance traveled by metropass holders, it may be possible to offer rewards or discounts to those who use their metropasses frequently, encouraging more people to use public transit and reducing the need for private vehicle ownership. A privacy layer can always be baked into the code.

Deal flow refers to the flow of potential business opportunities that a company or organization is considering or pursuing. In the context of finance and investment, deal flow typically refers to the volume and variety of investment opportunities that are available to an investor or investment firm. Deal flow can be an important factor in determining the success of an investment strategy, as having a strong deal flow can enable an investor to identify and pursue high-quality investment opportunities.

Deal flow can come from a variety of sources, including investment banks, venture capital firms, private equity firms, and other organizations. In general, organizations with a strong deal flow are well positioned to identify and pursue promising investment opportunities, as they have access to a wide range of potential deals to consider. Deal flow can also be influenced by market conditions and trends, as well as the reputation and credibility of the organization.

NFT metropasses may present an advertising revenue opportunity through the use of NFTs-as-a-service. By leveraging the unique capabilities of NFTs, it may be possible to create advertising campaigns that are more targeted, interactive, and engaging for users. For example, NFT metropasses could be used to deliver personalized advertisements to users based on their interests and preferences, or to offer interactive experiences that allow users to engage with the content in a more meaningful way.

NFT metropasses could also be used to track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and to gather valuable data about user behavior and preferences. This data could be used to optimize and improve future advertising efforts, enabling companies to better understand and reach their target audiences.

Overall, the use of NFT metropasses as a platform for advertising could potentially provide a new and innovative way for companies to reach and engage with consumers, while also generating revenue for the transit system.

In summary, the gameification of decarbonization can be a powerful tool for driving positive change and transition to a more sustainable future. By using innovative technologies like NFTs and blockchain, it is possible to incentivize and reward individuals and organizations for their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a cleaner, greener future.

NFTs as a service, or NFTaaS, can play a key role in driving the gameification of decarbonization, enabling the growth of the Canadian GDP and the identity verification market, and facilitating fundraising for capital repairs with the transition to a more sustainable future in mind. NFTaaS can also enable the use of payment streaming and rebate programs to encourage local travel and the use of immersive technologies like AR/VR/IR/XR for tourism.

The use of A.I. can also be a powerful tool in driving the gameification of decarbonization, enabling the use of hive plasticity and federations to bring about social cohesion and community integration. NFT metropasses, in particular, can offer a range of benefits, including continuous discounts for users, enhanced service analytics, and the opportunity to generate advertising revenue. By leveraging the unique capabilities of NFTs, it is possible to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.

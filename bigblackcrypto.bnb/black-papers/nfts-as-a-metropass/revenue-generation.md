# Revenue Generation

The integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into public transportation systems presents a unique opportunity for both users and businesses. The concept of NFTs as a Metropass (NFTaaM) utilizes the capabilities of NFTs to provide a secure and convenient way for users to access public transportation, while also leveraging watch-to-earn protocols to generate ad revenue, increase user engagement, and provide educational content.

The use of NFTs as a metropass can be applied to various public transportation systems, but for the purpose of this paper, we will focus on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) as an example. The TTC averages 5.5 million users per month, presenting a significant opportunity for revenue generation through advertising and other monetization strategies. By utilizing the captive audience of TTC users, businesses can reach a large and engaged audience that may be difficult to target through traditional advertising methods.

In this paper, we explore the various ways in which NFTaaM can leverage watch-to-earn protocols to generate revenue, increase user engagement, and provide educational content. We will also discuss how NFTaaM can be used to encourage sustainable transportation habits and create more opportunities for local businesses. We will explore the potential benefits and limitations of NFTaaM, as well as its future potential for revenue generation and user engagement. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the concept of NFTs as a metropass and its potential applications in public transportation.\

# NFTs-as-a-Metropass

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that can be bought, sold, and traded on blockchain networks. They are unique and cannot be replaced or exchanged for an identical asset.

&#x20;NFTs as a form of metropass for transportation. This would involve creating NFTs that represent a certain number of rides or access to certain transportation services, such as buses or trains. These NFTs could be bought and sold on a blockchain network and used for transportation in a similar way to traditional metropasses.

The idea behind this concept is that it could evolve transportation as a whole by creating a more efficient and decentralized system for purchasing and using transportation services. NFTs could also potentially be used to create a "hub of community" by allowing individuals to easily access and share transportation services in a secure and transparent way.

The concept of "Hive Plasticity" refers to the ability of the blockchain to adapt and evolve with the community. This can be seen as a feature of NFTs as metropass, which can be personalized and adapt to the needs of different individuals and communities.

The "neural highways" and "security metrics" likely refers to the use of blockchain technology to create secure and fast transactions and data storage. The BNB Chain, is a blockchain network developed by Binance, which allow to create BNB Domains and allows the use of Binance Coin (BNB) as a means of exchange.

The concept of using NFTs as a form of metropass for transportation could also lead to the creation of a "new commons" where equity on the blockchain is truly possible. This is because NFTs, as a decentralized and transparent form of digital asset, could potentially be used to create a more fair and equitable system for accessing transportation services.

By using NFTs as a form of metropass, individuals would be able to purchase and use transportation services in a more democratic and decentralized way. This could potentially reduce barriers to access, such as income and social inequality, and create a more equitable system for all individuals.

Additionally, the transparency and immutability of the blockchain could also help ensure that the distribution of transportation services is fair and equitable. This is because all transactions and data on the blockchain are recorded in a public ledger, allowing for greater transparency and accountability in the distribution of transportation services.

### _Why Fund The Acceleration of Its Adoption:_

Overall, the concept of using NFTs as a metropass for transportation could lead to the creation of a "new commons" where equity on the blockchain is truly possible, by providing a decentralized, transparent, and fair system for accessing transportation services.

using NFTs as a form of metropass for transportation has the potential to serve a city in a way that enhances the sovereignty of its inhabitants. By using a decentralized and transparent system for purchasing and using transportation services, it could potentially reduce the influence of foreign interference and regional state or provincial undermining.

The use of NFTs as metropass could also potentially put a city on a federal level by increasing its GDP through the growth of a more efficient and decentralized transportation system. This could also potentially attract more businesses and investment to the city, further boosting its economy.

There are indeed numerous reasons to justify the acceleration of such technology, such as the potential for cost savings, increased efficiency and security, and improved accessibility for transportation services. Doubling the funding up front could potentially magnify the output ahead of 2030 and accelerate the implementation and adoption of this technology.

However, it's important to also consider the potential challenges and risks associated with implementing such a system, such as regulatory compliance, data privacy, and security. It's important to have a thorough understanding of these factors before committing to the acceleration of this technology.

In addition to the economic benefits, using NFTs as a metropass for transportation could also have a positive impact on the environment. By making it easier for individuals to access and share transportation services, it could potentially reduce the number of cars on the road and decrease carbon emissions. This could be a major step towards sustainability and addressing climate change.

Furthermore, implementing NFTs as metropass could also provide opportunities for innovation and experimentation in the transportation industry. For example, it could enable the creation of new transportation services such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, or ride-sharing that could be more accessible to a wider range of people.

It's also worth noting that NFTs could also be used to create a more inclusive and equitable system for transportation services by providing individuals with greater access to transportation services regardless of their location, income or mobility needs.

In conclusion, there are many reasons to justify the acceleration of technology such as NFTs as metropass for transportation, including economic growth, environmental sustainability, innovation, and inclusivity. However, it's important to also consider the potential challenges and risks associated with such a system and have a proper plan in place to mitigate them.

# ðŸš€ Getting to Market

_The timeline for bringing NFTaaM technology to market would depend on a number of factors, such as the complexity of the system, the level of investment and resources available, and the regulatory environment._

Assuming that the necessary technology, such as blockchain infrastructure, is already in place and that the necessary partnerships and collaborations have been established, it could take several months to a couple of years to design, test and implement a pilot project for NFTaaM in public transportation. This pilot project would then need to be evaluated, and the results analyzed, to determine whether the technology is viable, and what, if any, adjustments need to be made before a full-scale deployment.

After that, the implementation and scaling of the technology across a larger public transportation system could take several more years, depending on the size and complexity of the system, as well as the level of buy-in and support from stakeholders such as transit agencies, governments, and riders.

It's important to note that the technology is still in development phase and its implementation would also be dependent on the level of adoption and support from the public transportation industry and government regulators, as well as the availability of resources and funding to develop and implement the technology.

There are other factors that could influence the timeline for bringing NFTaaM technology to market, such as the regulatory environment and legal framework. The use of blockchain technology and NFTs in public transportation is a relatively new concept, and governments and regulatory bodies may need to develop new laws and regulations to accommodate this technology as a layer of added user protection. We encourage this simply for public peace of mind, and the inclusion of established leadership. This could take time, and could potentially delay the implementation of NFTaaM.

Another factor that could impact the timeline is the level of adoption and support from the public transportation industry and its stakeholders. The success of NFTaaM technology will depend on its acceptance and adoption by transit agencies, commuters and other stakeholders. This may require significant education and awareness campaigns, as well as addressing any concerns or objections that stakeholders may have.

In summary, while it is difficult to give an exact timeline for bringing NFTaaM technology to market, it is likely that it would take several years, potentially several months to a couple of years for a pilot project, and several more years for a full-scale deployment, depending on the various factors involved.

### _**How Could the Timeline be Sped up, &**_ _**The Merits as to Why it Should be Accelerated**_

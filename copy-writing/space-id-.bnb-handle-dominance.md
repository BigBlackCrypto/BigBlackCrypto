_Two months later‚Ä¶ nearing 100,000 user milestone_

**Token SPACE ID ‚Äî** [_**link to contract**_](https://bscscan.com/token/0xe3b1d32e43ce8d658368e2cbff95d57ef39be8a6) _**|**_** Overview BEP-721**\
Total Supply: 289,922 **SID |** Holders: 98,855 addresses

_**Identity Verification Markets ‚Äî Global IVM (G-IVM):**_\
The span of 2022‚Äì2030 forecasts 16.7% CAGR. Estimated growth to $33bn by 2030 is conservative. For perspective if CRYPTO MARKETs were set to expand by 178% (user adoption), the math doesn‚Äôt factor that in. If _global cryptocurrency market size is expected to reach USD 11.71 trillion by 2030, registering a **CAGR of 12.2%** from 2022 to 2030‚Ä¶ so IVM or G-IVM numbers don‚Äôt adequaletly appraise compounded growth._

The emergence of web3 handles, and interoperable multi-utile domain use presents unique growth metrics unchartered. Large corporations like Youtube are accelerating adoption, & the tsunami of onboarding is coming but who I ask, is best suited to capture a large swath of market during bullish times‚Ä¶ Personally I view SPACE ID as the one to accomplish such a feat, and their. .bnb crypto handles are poised to succeed in market. By contrast they already have 9.2x volume of domains. And .bnb has 4 times as many holders as there are domains registered by the nearest Binance ecosystem competitor. They aren‚Äôt niche anymore, SPACE ID has carved out the lions share of their ecosystem market. They are poised to eclipse 1.2M users by Q3 of 2023 ( 1year from list date)‚Ä¶ again that would be by conservative estimates. We view it possible that .bnb exceeds 2.1M users by said time frame.

Web3 handles, or crypto domains aren‚Äôt some fashionable trend that‚Äôll disappear with a change of season. Youtube for example released 1 billion handles in 2022 . In 2021, $8.48bn for G-IVM‚Äôs (total)‚Ä¶ now 1bn people have been exposed to ‚Äúweb3 domains‚Äù, ‚Äúpayment streaming‚Äù whether they know it or not, and ‚Äúhuman readable ‚Äòcrypto handles‚Äô. Youtube just put 1 billion users into fair play‚Ä¶ soon users will be able to route a proper wallet to their ad-sense rev pay out instead‚Ä¶. Still that‚Äôs potentially 1 billion users. 1% of 1 billion is still 10,000,000 million users.

FAST STATS:\
\[_Binance had **28.6 million annual users on its platform in 2021**, an increase of 7.1 million users from the previous year. Binance‚Äôs 24 hour trading volume reached $76 billion in 2021, which was more than twice its 2020 peak. More than $9 trillion was traded on Binance in 2021.]_

On that notion, know that at any moment in time‚Ä¶. .bnb could flip .eth over night. There exists an explosive pressure‚Ä¶. A very momentous upside is in the forecast.

By contrast Binance has 1.7M holders of the binance coin‚Ä¶. Statistically SPACE ID in 2 short months has amassed a user base that reflects 5.8% of all people hodling the Binance token. .bnb dominance is a real thing. It started with the best damn launch I‚Äôve ever had the luxury of being apart of. It was professionally run. The phases left nothing to imagination‚Ä¶. Users got the chance to mint between 2 to 5 names fairly. Creating an auction if two or more users chose the same name, this was so exciting to see in real time via [https://spaceid.stevenlei.com/](https://spaceid.stevenlei.com/). The fanfare this community tool added to the event has to be stated, and the developer praised.

Remember for someone who‚Äôs never taken part in auction, is now accessing an explorer and watching every bid imaginable fly. At peak there were 3800+ active bids when the clock neared close.

I recorded the final 30 minutes of the auction, and I have to admit‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt expect people to bid what I saw being bid. 228 BNB is a lot of conviction for 888.bnb

_**Why would someone pay that much for a premium handle?**_

It‚Äôs because of the legacy inherent to a simplified identity stack. These are accessible surface points. It‚Äôs chosen identity‚Ä¶ and choosing your identity is priceless. It‚Äôs like rebirth.

Did you know .bnb to .bnb crypto rails execute w/ finality at a speed on par w/ xrp, if not faster.\
\
This is the most compelling argument for securing the .bnb handle one desires. Ease of use, and user to user interactions via human readable names.

_**Did you know that .bnb handles do work on metamask?**_

Next time you send look at the blue checkmark that appears in wallet to verify their existence. I‚Äôve beta tested over 200 wallets and the ‚Äúauto‚Äù recognition of the recipient was a first I noticed. I adored seeing this. It makes the human readable part, that much more personable. _**I know that I‚Äôm sending it to a recipient when I see the blue icon appear.**_\

**Whats an ‚Äúidentity stack‚Äù?**\
‚ÄúIdentity Stack is **a digital identity mangement solutions to help customers enhance the security by leveraging the capabilities of identity infrastructure‚Ä¶‚Äù**. ‚Äî TheHub.io

Choosing a .bnb crypto handle represents the #1 choice in identity management solutions, and I stand by it. Out of all the BINANCE ecosystem naming service projects‚Ä¶ SPACE ID‚Äôs .bnb‚Äôs are the only one that‚Äôs SDK integrated to resolved all domains.

As a universal name service network, .bnb connects people, information, and assets across all blockchains and apps. That is correct, it‚Äôs chain agnostic. It‚Äôs open sourced. It‚Äôs decentralized, and it‚Äôs censorship-resistant. SPACE ID isn‚Äôt just issuing .bnb top level domains, their also operating as an aggregate to resolve all of our identities, & multichain addresses. So realistically people are personalizing their _identity stacks_.

Your bank owns over 10,000 blockchain patents‚Ä¶ but you have never been able to name your chequing account. They look at you awkwardly when you seek to open a second savings account‚Ä¶ and deny you equitable financing despite the length of your relationship. Their is no reputational leveraging of a decades long relationship. To any and all finance institutions, we really are just lazy liquidity‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre so domesticated we don‚Äôt ask for better. We don‚Äôt pursue personalization or identity.

Hence why over 100,000 people have chosen to Replace their complex addresses with human-readable identity for their web3 interactions. The people are personalizing their experiences. They are choosing their chains.

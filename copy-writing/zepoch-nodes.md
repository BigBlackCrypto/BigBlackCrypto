🚨ZEBEC MIGRATES TO BNB CHAIN 🚨… leaving Solana

FUNFACT — _**Did you know that Zebec’s 2nd ever BSC integration partner is SPACE ID.**_ Zebec was already planning to go multi-chain, but after current events and recent outtages, they made the move to leave Solana. This is huge news because ZEBEC was “Solana’s” 1st project ever to be apart of the Visa Fast Track Program… just completely migrated too BNB Chain!!! Meaning when their dApp is finished on BNB Chain, that’s when......

So dear .bnb domain friends & BNB Chain friends, here’s a list of benefits to being a ZEPOCH node operator:

1. **Node Revenue**\
   Once Zebec Chain is live, Zepoch nodes will be prioritized for validation rights and receive on-chain transaction fees (GAS Fees), which are expected to have a 4–7% APY. 👀
2. **Revenue Share**\
   After the launch of the Zepoch ecosystem, 20% of the profit will be used as buyback every year for Zepoch holders. 🔥
3. **Whitelist Privilege**\
   Zepoch holders will have access to the whitelist of Zebec Chain’s ecosystem, entitled to early participation rights and airdrops from all IDO projects on the Zebec Chain ecosystem.
4. **Zebec Airdrops**\
   Once the number of nodes reaches 15,000, Zebec will airdrop 1,000,000 ZBC per day to Zepoch holders, which will be halved in 3 months and continued until the main net is launched (about one year). ☄️
5. **Boost Rewards**\
   Each Zepoch holder will receive up to 20% of the Boost Reward for inviting a friend. Earn 5% of the rewards of your friend’s airdrop as long you refer a friend. 🤝
6. **Zepoch Node Appreciation**\
   The price of a Zepoch node starts from $2000. For every 50 Zepoch purchased, the price will increase by 0.5% 💪🏼
7. **Referral Program**\
   The Zepoch Node Holder (Referrer) will receive a 5% real-time rebate (in USDT) for every single invitation through the referral program. 📈
8. **Early Builders Incentives**The contributions of the early builders are based on points, in which cash prizes await! 👀

As per leadership @ ZEBEC\

[How To Buy + Referral Code (referral code is needed to buy\
https://medium.com/@bigblackcryp-to/zebec-zepoch-node-nfts-7e6bcc7d2e40](https://medium.com/@bigblackcryp-to/zebec-zepoch-node-nfts-7e6bcc7d2e40)

[Why operate a node?](https://medium.com/@bigblackcryp-to/zebec-zepoch-node-nfts-7e6bcc7d2e40)

1. It allows a user to interact & operate within the network more securely and with more privacy.
2. Its relatively simple to set up, anticipate hardware specs to be listed in the coming months. ZEBEC just launched their mainnet.
3. In becoming a blockchain validator, by providing computing capacity you enable a 24/7 up-time in supporting the chain as an operator. There are no miners. Think of your self as a “transaction moderator”. You oversee the gossip, but rarely will you ever have to moderate the conversation.
4. Governance — Now the first 288 user who acquired a node received the themis gavel. There are 29,712 themis governance gavel nft’s remaining. Those will have to be earned. Holding such an nft will enable voting onn matters specific to on-chain governance.
5. On-chain Diversity is Security — the more diverse and decentralized the more resilient our fault tolerance becomes. The Zebec ecosphere wont be subsceptible to centralized attacks that focus on single points of failure at the edge. Users will be expected to run dedicated computers/servers 24/7
6. Better Data: Running your own node, makes you a local host & automatically you’ll have access to far better analytics; pending transactions, like whale activity, daily volume, knowing the hashrate, and understanding any potential congestion on the network.
7. Near real time settlement — ZEBEC will have the advantage of settling in seconds. The advantage of being decentralized at scale means transactions process faster, as any cluster of nodes, can interact and review, as opposed too waiting 15 minutes or an hour. Regardless of the size of the sum… in mere seconds.

# 🌍 Vision Statement

## The "Why" Behind our Purpose

&#x20;        There is a need for an _**interstitial layer**_ that repairs, that mends user agency, thus restoring ability to custody one's own funds. **We envision a world where we become the choice enterprise solution to "self-custody" at the consumer level.** We will level the playing field. Through low code, we can free a populous from their "open air prison". Digital feudalism shortens lives, and deteriorates public health. Mentally it deprives them of hope, & we desire to counter this "nothingness" feeling with meaningful prosperity. Societal think shifts when people have the tools to compete for their goals. ACH is feeless, yet so profitable users can't invest in it...&#x20;

_**\[its so profitable very few innovations have been built upon it in recent years]**_ \
_****_\
_****_Yet so vulnerable during the Rogers Outage 2022, 38 million Canadians lost access to their debit & visa cards when the primary service provider's monopoly was hacked. The network we've chosen to innovate on is significantly better in this regard.

&#x20;         Furthermore, IDP (interact direct payment) has made buying things easier, but hasn't lead to equity or equality in other aspects. There are better solutions, & #BigBlackCrypto will introduce said solutions to the underserved Canadian markets.&#x20;

What we will deliver will be "value capture resistant". It will have a decentralizing effect on centralized powers whom concentrate wealth. This is why we're catering to the individual user. We are not yelling into the void, or competing w/ banking institutions. We are buidling a better world!\

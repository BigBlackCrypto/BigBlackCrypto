We’re a web3 onboarding services company that specializes in ambassadorial moderation and community building. We have a demonstrated track record as a technical liaison between “merged” groups. We are building a domain naming server to satisfy the identity verification market CAGR into 2030. We will issue SLD’s or subdomains via our exotic collection of over 500 TLD’s.

We are not a crypto company... we are an "IVM" sector serving enterprise. We serve users from all walks of life.&#x20;

Great leadership requires proper stewardship, and I have the foresight to deliver results.\

I waited 2 years to attain an ambassadorial role w/in Binance .bnb \
(SPACE ID) after ENS launched .eth. I know the market. I studied TNS (terra naming service) and called the Terra Luna collapse 1 yr before the collapse. I called the Celsius collapse from 8 months before it happened. I called the SBF x FTX “FTT” collapse back in June. Our research is extraordinary. So when everyone else was getting rekt playing with their treasuries… and user funds. We exited market and deployed capital into developer tools and access to other building resources.

I own my domain name across all chains. I’ve yet to meet anyone else who’s done that. We recognize the challenges. There just isn’t variety… and we’d be happy to give users the variety that co-insides w/ their multi-chain adventures 😏. The gas fees at times are just outrageous enough to sour the user experience. This is why we sweeten things up w/ cooler options.
